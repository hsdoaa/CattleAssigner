assign_animal2breed is a framework that deploys various Machine Learning (ML) models/classifiers for assigning animal to one of four types of breeds (cattle
populations) usning the minimum number of Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) determined by different feature reduction and feature selection techniques. The breeds types include African lineage, Indicine lineage, European lineage, and Admixed lineage.  The ML models include:

Support vector machine (SVR)

Neural Network

k-nearest neighbors (KNN)

Random forest (RF) 

Decision tree (DT)

Logistic regression (LR)

Naive bayes (NB)

XGBoost




All the ML classifers have been implemented in python using Scikit-learn library except XGBoost that has been implemented using Python XGBoost package.
