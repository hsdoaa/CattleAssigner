# assign_animal2breed is a framework that deply various Machine Learing (ML) models/classifers for assigning animal to one of four types of breeds (cattle
populations) usning the minimum number of Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The breeds typs include African lineage, Indicine lineage, European lineage, and 
Admixed lineag.  The ML models include:

Support vector machine (SVR)

Neural Network

k-nearest neighbors (KNN)

Random forest (RF) 

Decision tree (DT)

Logistic regression (LR)

Naive bayes (NB)

XGBoost




All the classifers are implemented in python using Scikit-learn library.
